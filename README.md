# Stanford Algorithm Specialization


## 1. Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms

  The primary topics in this part of the specialization are: asymptotic ("Big-oh") notation, sorting and searching, divide and conquer (master method, integer and matrix multiplication, closest pair), and randomized algorithms (QuickSort, contraction algorithm for min cuts).

 - Week 1: [Karasuba](https://github.com/Sofinelye/Stanford/blob/master/Course_1/IntegerArray.py)
 - Week 2: [IntegerArray](https://github.com/Sofinelye/Stanford/blob/master/Course_1/IntegerArray.py)
 - Week 3: [MergeSort](https://github.com/Sofinelye/Stanford/blob/master/Course_1/MergeSort.py)
 - Week 4: [kargerMinCut](https://github.com/Sofinelye/Stanford/blob/master/Course_1/Karger.py) *
    
## 2. Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures

  The primary topics in this part of the specialization are: data structures (heaps, balanced search trees, hash tables, bloom filters), graph primitives (applications of *breadth-first and *depth-first search, connectivity, shortest paths), and their applications (ranging from deduplication to social network analysis).

## 3. Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming

  The primary topics in this part of the specialization are: greedy   algorithms (scheduling, minimum spanning trees, clustering, Huffman codes) and dynamic programming (knapsack, sequence alignment, optimal search trees).

## 4. Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-complete Problems and What to Do about Them

  The primary topics in this part of the specialization are: shortest paths (Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, Johnson), NP-completeness and what it means for the algorithm designer, and strategies for coping with computationally intractable problems (analysis of heuristics, local search).
